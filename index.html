Oh strange wond'rous game.
About whom I have only just learned your name.
Your colours seem stark and fine.
I wonder if you will be a waste of time.

The name Earthtongue gives me the willies.
Were you mucking around or just being silly?
It brings to mind licking the ground.
Of this fine planet so large and round.

In reality I could afford your fee.
Five dollars would not be ruinous to me.
But I was so intrigued by this payment by art.
It was time to break out my poetry smarts.

Though rusty and useless by all normal standards.
Devoid of purpose, in circles it meanders.
I can still hack out some doggerel verse.
Why don't you try you couldn't do worse.

About the game its time for me to learn.
Give me a minute for my key to earn.
Go about your business, your reading please pause.
While I find out the game rules and all of its laws.

OK I'm back would you like to find out.
What I have discovered when I want for a scout?
Our story takes place in a world far away.
(All planets are far so I didn't need to say.)

You'll need some patience as the action gets going.
Unlike real gardening there's no weeding and hoeing.
You seed various fungi all over the surface.
But not too much - that would lead to a surfeit.

A menu of minibeasts allows you to choose.
Which kind of creature you would like to use.
To keep down the various species of plant.
I see flies and snails but no sign of the ant.

Mold, mushrooms and pods I'm feeling confused.
I'll RTFM and learn the cool moves.
To beat this game well in not too much time.
Please send me my key, it ought to be mine.

As a P.S. I'd just like to say.
I'm looking forward to having a play.
I write code myself for a living all day.
If it's at all good, I also will pay.
