I'd just like to say.\r\nI'm looking forward to having a play.\r\nI write code myself for a living all day.\r\nIf it's at all good, I also will pay.\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSee Earthtongue at:\r\n[http://erichermit.itch.io/earth-tongue](http://erichermit.itch.io/earth-tongue)\r\n\r\n[https://twitter.com/avimssilver](https://twitter.com/avimssilver)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
